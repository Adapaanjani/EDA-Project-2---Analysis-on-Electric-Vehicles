🔋🚗 **Unlocking Insights from Electric Vehicle Data with Data Science!** 🚗🔋

I’m excited to share my latest project where I had the opportunity to work with a rich dataset on **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in using data science tools to analyze, visualize, and uncover meaningful trends in the EV industry. 🌍💡

The electric vehicle market is growing rapidly, and I was able to use data to tell the story of this transformation—highlighting not only the rise in EV adoption but also the shifting preferences of consumers across regions and brands.

### 🚀 **Project Highlights**:

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Digging into the Data**  
To start, I conducted both **univariate and bivariate analyses** to understand the underlying structure of the dataset. The goal was to extract insights into how factors like **vehicle make**, **model year**, and **electric range** were distributed across various regions.  
- I applied descriptive statistics to summarize key variables, uncovering trends like the increase in electric range over time, the dominance of specific EV manufacturers in different states, and the changes in **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility**.  
- Bivariate analysis helped me explore relationships between variables such as **EV make and electric range**, and **EV model year and state distribution**, shedding light on the most popular models and manufacturers in various regions.  

**2. Visualizing Geographical Distribution – Choropleth Map**  
Using **Plotly Express**, I built an interactive **Choropleth map** to visualize the distribution of electric vehicles across the United States. This map provided a clear geographical perspective on where electric vehicle adoption is most prevalent.  
- Each state was color-coded based on the number of EVs, with dynamic zoom features allowing for detailed exploration. This visual was incredibly helpful in understanding which regions are leading the charge in EV adoption and how policies or incentives might be influencing this.  
- By focusing on state-level insights, I was able to highlight hotspots of EV adoption, such as California and Washington, which have been at the forefront of the electric revolution.  

**3. Animated Racing Bar Plot – EV Make Growth Over Time**  
To visualize how the market for electric vehicles has evolved over time, I created an **animated racing bar chart** using the **Bar Chart Race** library. This animation captured the year-by-year growth of major EV manufacturers, showing how each company has gained or lost market share.  
- The racing bar chart is a compelling way to observe the rise of key players like **Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, and Ford** in the EV space. It provides a year-by-year visualization of EV sales across manufacturers, making it easy to see which companies are leading the market in innovation and adoption.  
- Watching this animation, it was fascinating to see how new entrants disrupted the market and how some manufacturers grew rapidly due to the increasing demand for electric vehicles and the development of better battery technologies.  

### 💻 **Tools & Technologies**  
Throughout the project, I leveraged a powerful set of tools:  
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis using libraries like **Pandas** to clean, organize, and summarize data.  
- **Plotly Express** for building interactive visualizations, including scatter plots, choropleth maps, and animated bar plots.  
- **Bar Chart Race** for the creation of the animated racing bar plot to visualize the dynamic growth of EV manufacturers.  

### 💡 **Takeaways**  
This project has deepened my understanding of the electric vehicle market and solidified my skills in data analysis and visualization. I’ve gained a strong appreciation for how **data storytelling** can bring complex trends to life, making them more understandable and impactful for decision-makers.  
- **Data visualization** is incredibly important when communicating insights—whether it’s tracking the growth of a market, understanding regional adoption trends, or comparing the performance of different players in the industry.  
- Electric vehicles are not just a technological revolution but also a data-rich industry with endless opportunities for innovation and optimization.  

A huge thank you to **Kanav Bansal**, my mentor, for providing valuable guidance, and to **Innomatics Research Labs** for their support throughout this journey. I’m excited to keep pushing forward in the world of data science and uncovering new ways to apply these skills to industries that are changing our world. 🌱⚡
